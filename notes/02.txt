Example
7 6 4 2 1
1 2 7 8 9
9 7 6 2 1
1 3 2 4 5
8 6 4 4 1
1 3 6 7 9


number of safe reports

adjacent numbers need to be either increasing or decreasing
numbers must differ by at least one and at most three


enumerator function each_cons

problem dampener
7 6 4 2 1 -> safe
1 2 7 8 9
unsafe because 2 and 7

2 7 8 9
1 7 8 9
1 2 8 9
1 2 7 8


if line is safe fine

otherwise for every unsafe line
1...n leave out 0th element
0, 2, 3, 4 leave out first element
0, 1, 3, 4 leave out second element
0, 1, 3, 4 leave out third element
0, 1, 2, 3 leave out forth element
