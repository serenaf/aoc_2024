read in the lines into a grid system

[x,y] to character

find the candidate coordinates, these are all the coordinates that start with an x
for each candidate coordinate at pos[x,y]


x-MAS

valid x-mas
m at pos[x,y]
a at pos[x+1, y+1]
s at pos[x+2, y+2]
m at post[x, y+2]
s at pos[x,y+2]

maybe it is easier to start with find the A
a at pos[x,y]

pos[x-1, y-1]
post[x-1, y+1]


pos[x+1, y-1]
post[x+1, y+1]


make sure it says mas in both cases
